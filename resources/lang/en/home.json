    "description2": "In 2021 we took the big step to change our English name from Christchurch Chinese Church to Christchurch Community Church. The reason; to make our church more inclusive, and send a message to our community that we are a church for all people, no matter where you are from. This is God's church and God welcomes all who will come to Him. We welcome you!"
